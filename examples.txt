  Hello, I am John Doe and I am a web developer. I live and work in
  somewhere warm. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript (and its endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the
  challenge of learning something new everyday. You can also find me at youtube

I believe that technology and software are crucial in improving individuals' and businesses' lives.
As I self taught Software Developer, I am always looking to find ways to solve a specific problem, and
on the hunt for ways to challenge and expand my skillset.

While I am skilled in different technology stacks, as a daily user of Apple products, I am passionate about
building projects and apps that I can develop natively for the devices I use the most. This is why I have chosen to building
mobile applications using Apple's own Swift programming language and SwiftUI framework.
